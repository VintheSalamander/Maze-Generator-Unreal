Name: Vineet Rajesh Nihalani Lalwani

Controls: WASD to move and the mouse to look left and right.

Instructions: First of all, I would recommend starting with the Unity Project, which is a more complete demo, and more easy
due perspective but if not:
The goal is to find the plant, which is in the soil(brown) area, and then delivered it to "Eva", 
which is shaped like a capsule and can be found in the white area.

Note: The walls in this demo are higher due to the change of camera perspective

Models created by me.
